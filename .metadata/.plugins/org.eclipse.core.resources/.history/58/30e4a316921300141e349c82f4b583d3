						"An expansion team formed in 1988, the Miami Heat began their early years with much mediocrity, only making the playoffs two times in their first eight years and falling in the first round both times. Upon the purchasing of the franchise by Micky Arison in 1995, Pat Riley was brought in as the team president and head coach. Riley acquired center Alonzo Mourning and point guard Tim Hardaway to serve as the centerpiece for the team, transforming Miami into a championship contender throughout the late 1990s.",
						"In the 2003 NBA Draft, with the fifth overall pick, Miami selected shooting guard Dwyane Wade out of Marquette.[3] Free­agent swing­man Lamar Odom was signed from the Los Angeles Clippers. Just prior to the start of the 03–04 season, Riley stepped down as head coach to focus on rebuilding the Heat, promoting Stan Van Gundy to the position of head coach. Behind Van Gundy's leadership, Wade's stellar rookie year and Odom's break out season, the Heat made the 2004 NBA Playoffs, beating the New Orleans Hornets 4–3 in the 1st round and losing to the Indiana Pacers 4–2 in the 2nd round. In the offseason, Riley engineered a summer blockbuster trade for Shaquille O'Neal from the Los Angeles Lakers.",
						'Entering the 2010–2011 season with nearly $48 million in salary cap space, the Heat caused a major power shift during the blockbuster 2010 NBA Free Agency, adding Chris Bosh and LeBron James to local superstar Dwyane Wade, starting the "Big 3" era. However, the Heat got off to an 8–14 start. After a "players only" meeting, the team pulled together. The Heat finished with a 58–24 record and the 2nd seed. In the much anticipated 2011 NBA Playoffs, Miami defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round, Boston Celtics in the Conference Semifinals, and Bulls in the Conference Finals, all in 5 games. The Heat reached the 2011 NBA Finals for the first time since 2006, in a rematch against the Dallas Mavericks.',

						'The Lakers franchise began in 1947 when Ben Berger and Morris Chalfen of Minnesota purchased the recently disbanded Detroit Gems of the National Basketball League (NBL) for $15,000 from Gems owner Maury Winston. Minneapolis sportswriter Sid Hartman played a key behind the scenes role in helping put together the deal and later the team.[9] Inspired by Minnesotas nickname, "Land of 10,000 Lakes", the team christened themselves the Lakers.[4][10] Hartman helped them hire John Kundla from College of St. Thomas, to be their first head coach, by meeting with him and selling him on the team.',
						'On July 9, 1968, the team acquired Wilt Chamberlain from the Philadelphia 76ers for Darrell Imhoff, Archie Clark, and Jerry Chambers.[48] In his first season as a Laker, Chamberlain set a team record by averaging a league­leading 21.1 rpg.[49] West, Baylor, and Chamberlain each averaged over 20 points, and Los Angeles won their division.[50] The Lakers and Celtics again met in the finals, and Los Angeles had home court advantage against Boston for the first time in their rivalry. They won the first game behind Jerry Wests 53 points, and had a 3–2 lead after five.[52] Boston won the series in seven games however,[53] and earned their 11th NBA Championship in 13 seasons. West was named the first­ever Finals MVP; this remains the only time that a member of the losing team has won the award.',
						'In the 1979 NBA Draft, Los Angeles selected 6­foot, 9­inch point guard Magic Johnson from Michigan State with the first overall pick.[86] It took Johnsons teammates time to acclimate themselves to his passing ability, as his "no­look" passes often caught them unaware. Once they adjusted, his passing became a key part of Los Angeles offense.The Lakers won 60 games in Johnsons rookie year, and defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in six games in the 1980 NBA Finals. Johnson won the series Finals MVP award, after starting at center for the injured Abdul­Jabbar in game six, and tallying 42 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists. The team fell off in the 1980–81 season, though, as the Lakers lost Johnson for most of the season to a knee injury. The team turned in a 54–28 record and finished second behind the Phoenix Suns in the Pacific Division. The Rockets, led by Moses Malone, defeated Los Angeles in the first round of the playoffs.',
						'Championship banners, Lakers retired jerseys, and honored Minneapolis Lakers banner hanging in the rafters of Staples Center During the 1996 off­season, the Lakers acquired 17­year­old Kobe Bryant from the Charlotte Hornets for Vlade Divac; Bryant was drafted 13th overall out of Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania in that years draft, by Charlotte. Los Angeles also signed free­agent Shaquille ONeal. Trading for Bryant was Wests idea, and he was influential in the teams signing of the all­star center. "Jerry West is the reason I came to the Lakers," ONeal later said.[133] They used their 24th pick in the draft to select Derek Fisher.[134] During the season, the team traded Cedric Ceballos to Phoenix for Robert Horry. ONeal led the team to a 56–26 record, their best effort since 1990–91, despite missing 31 games due to a knee injury. ONeal averaged 26.2 ppg and 12.5 rpg and finished third in the league in blocked shots (2.88 bpg) in 51 games. The Lakers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the 1997 NBA Playoffs. ONeal scored 46 points in Game 1 against the Trail Blazers, marking the ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼highest single­game playoff scoring output by a Laker since Jerry West scored 53 against the Celtics in 1969. In the next round, the Lakers lost four games to one to the Utah Jazz.'
